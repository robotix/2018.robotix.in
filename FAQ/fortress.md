**Q: How do I register for the event?**

Registration for the events has to be done from Kshitij’s
website. For the exact procedure, check www.ktj.in


**Q: Is there any abstract submission for the event?**

No abstract submission is required.


**Q: How many members can be there in a team?**

Each team can have a maximum of four members.


**Q: Do I need to bring my own marker during the event?**

No it is not required. We will provide you with a marker. You can also bring your own markers to localize your robots.


**Q: Will I be given time for thresholding (localization etc) before a run?**

Yes. You will be given sufficient time before a run (~20 mins) to
make thresholding changes.


**Q: Is hard coding allowed?**

NO! We will check your codes before your run. If hard coding is
detected, your run will not be considered.


**Q: Do I have to make the robot wired / wireless?**

It is your choice. Both are allowed. In case you are making a wired robot, we will be providing you with USB extenders.


**Q: What is the model of the overhead camera?**

Logitech B910 HD Webcam / Genius WideCam F100


**Q: How will we threshold the colours?**

You can easily create a sample image in Paint or just use the image provided in the arena. It would be preferable to use trackbars so that you can easily adjust the threshold. The actual thresholding can be done on-site so as to get an accurate judgement of all the range according to the lighting condition present there.


**Q: How exactly will the video feed reach the bot?**

We will have a USB 2.0 cable of the camera which can go into your laptop's port.


**Q: Can the bot be wireless?**

Yes the bot can be controlled without a wire by Bluetooth, WiFi, XeeBee, or any other stuff but the participant has to declare what she will be using during the run.


**Q: What will be the resolution of the video feed?**

We have provided the model of the camera ie. Logitech B910 HD webcam /
Genius WideCam F100.


**Q: How much time will we get between Round 1 and Round 2?**

Unfortunately, we cannot comment on that right now because it all depends on how many participants successfully complete the round. If all participants manage to complete the round within the first 6 hours, then we will give more than 24 hours to prepare for round 2 but the chances of this are highly unlikely as based on our previous experiences. But at a minimum, we will give approximately 8 hours in between. Also note, it is probable that if extremely few participants are able to complete Round 1 then there might not be a Round 2.


**Q: What is the role of the marker?**

The marker is used to get the information of the bot. You can easily get the center of the head and tail. With this information, you can locate the center of the bot as well as the direction of the bot.


**Q: What will be the RGB values of the shapes given in the image?**
Exact  RGB values of the shapes given in the image will be released before the run starts.


**Q: Does the robot have to return to the start point/centre of the arena after identifying each shape?**

No, bot has to traverse the shapes in the specified order without returning to the center point.


**Q:Will USB/programmer extenders be provided?**

Yes


**Q: Will the video feed consist of only the arena or it can have extra noise at the sides?**

It will only consist of the arena.


**Q: When will the colour priority order be given and how?**

It will be announced before the run.


**Q: How and when will the image be given?**

Every team will be provided an image through pen drive just before the run.


**Q: Can the inbuilt LED of an Arduino be used?**

No, the LED of an Arduino can’t  be used as it is not visible enough to count the number of times it blinks. The LED used should be properly visible.


**Q: What are obstacles in the second round?**

The shapes which are present in the arena but are not there in the given image are considered as obstacles. They are at the same level as all the other shapes.There will be negative marking in case the bot steps over them.
